# Question 3

What should be on the quiz?

If you had control of building a quiz to assess knowledge of what the students in 204 learned for propositional semantics,
what question would you ask? Keep in mind that there are roughly 3-4 questions / quiz, and only 60min in total.

Only constraint is that you shouldn't just mirror one of the assignment or weekly practice questions. Try to be creative, and
the best questions very well may appear on a future quiz!

As for me, I think the questions of the quiz should be more conprehensive,but still have a focus. For example, I think the questions of the quiz should be focus on the knowledge which did not appear in this assignment. Moreover, without the kind of questions in this assignment, maybe we can put some definintion questions in the quiz so that we could have a better understanding of each definintion and we could apply each definintion more proficiently. For example, we could ask that the definition or theorem of satisfiability and validity, the difference between disjunctive normal form and conjunctive normal form. The above is all my thoughts about this quiz.
